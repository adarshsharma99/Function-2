        "- Purpose of the return Statement in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "The return statement in a Python function is used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Exit the function: When a return statement is encountered, the function execution is terminated, and control is passed back to the caller.\n",
        "2. Return a value: The return statement can specify a value to be returned to the caller, which can then be used in the calling code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "def add(a, b):\n",
        "\n",
        "    result = a + b\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 5\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the add function calculates the sum of a and b and returns the result using the return statement. The returned value is then assigned to the result variable in the calling code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Optional: The return statement is optional. If omitted, the function will return None by default.\n",
        "2. Multiple returns: A function can have multiple return statements, which can be used to return different values based on conditions.\n",
        "3. Early exit: The return statement can be used to exit a function early, before reaching the end of the function body.\n",
        "\n",
        "Best practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use return consistently: Be consistent in using return statements throughout your code to make it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
        "2. Document return values: Clearly document the return values of your functions to help others understand how to use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using the return statement effectively, you can write functions that are more flexible, reusable, and efficient.\n",
